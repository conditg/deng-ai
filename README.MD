# Predicting Dengue Fever

DrivenData has launched a competition called "DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread". The goal of the competition is to predict how many cases a given area will report each week, and to understand the drivers of outbreaks of Dengue Fever. A Solution could aid local authorities in slowing the spread of the disease or fighting its causes.

### Data
The data is provided by DrivenData and is aggregated from a number of publicly available sources detailed [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/page/82/). 

The underlying hypothesis appears to be that Mosquitos are the primary source that spread the disease, and that Mosquito activity can be predicted in part by weather and climate trends. The competition also allows for supplementary data, which I may explore given that this type of data is regularly available publicly.

### Techniques and Challenges

From the course, I anticipate using the following:

- Feature Engineering
- Linear, Ridge, Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regressor, KNN Regressor, SVM Regressor
- Grid Search
- Miscellaneous visualizations
- ARIMA and other time series techniques
- I also plan to try an LSTM if I'm able to get enough samples from supplemenary sources.

These last two are likely to be the biggest challenges. My specialization was in Big Data, not Time Series, but the project I built for that is robust enough to stand on it's own separate from my capstone and I'm trying to diversity my portfolio, so I will be leaning on the Time Series specialization despite not having completed it.
