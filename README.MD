# Predicting Dengue Fever

DrivenData has launched a competition called "DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread". The goal of the competition is to predict how many cases a given area will report each week, and to understand the drivers of outbreaks of Dengue Fever. A Solution could aid local authorities in slowing the spread of the disease or fighting its causes.

### Data
The data is provided by DrivenData and is aggregated from a number of publicly available sources detailed [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/page/82/).
